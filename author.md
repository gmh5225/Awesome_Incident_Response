Hello visitor!
<img align="left" src="./images/bill-bio.jpeg" width="300" alt="Bill Swearingen's bio picture" title="Bill Swearingen">
I am Bill Swearingen (hevnsnt), a super nerd about anything and everything cyber security. I started on the mean streets of the hacking scene and grew up into a career where I have run extremely large security teams for the largest of companies. This has given me a unique background to fully understand significantly advanced cyber attacks and managing corporate risk. I geek out at finding solutions which enable companies to succeed… securely.

**Strong expertise in the following areas:**
Incident Response, Computer Forensics, Security policy development & enforcement, Security product development, Cryptography, Blockchain, virtual currency, Legal and regulatory compliance, Information security risk assessment, Cloud Security, Modern Authentication, Vulnerability assessment, Team building and management, Malware analysis, DDoS mitigation, Large Language Models (LLM), AI, and long lists of things in camelCase.


**My super power is understanding how something works and teaching it to others.**

I have been the founder of many security-related organizations such as SecKC (seckc.org) and the Cowtown Computer Congress (c3kc.org) and have served as President of Kansas City's FBI Infragard.

Active participant in National Defense and Financial Services ISACs, M3AAWG, Women in Security, DEF CON, Black Hat, and various private threat sharing organizations.

I am a big believer in “be nice" and "the harder you work, the luckier you get" If you really want to get on my good side, show me something you made. :)
